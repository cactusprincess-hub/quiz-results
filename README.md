# Quiz Results and Code Repository

## Description

This repository contains the results and related code for the quiz assignment. It includes:
- Code used to compute the results.
- The results themselves (e.g., embeddings, visualizations).
- Explanation of how to run the code and interpret the results.

## Files in this repository

1. **`visualize_embeddings.py`**: The main script used to visualize the embeddings using t-SNE and PCA.(the embeddings are too much ,the figure without PCA also in the hub and you will know why i choose PCA)
2. **`embeddings_output.txt`**: The result file containing the embeddings from the first dataset.
3. **`new_embeddings_output.txt`**: The result file containing the embeddings from the second dataset.（because the 435&436 sequence are too long,i have to edit a new code to cut the long sequence then select the embeddings）
4. **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## How to Run the Code

Follow these steps to run the code on your local machine:

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed on your system. You will also need `conda` or `pip` to install required dependencies.

### 2. Create a New Conda Environment

You can create a new environment by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
conda create -n plasmidgpt python=3.10
conda activate plasmidgpt
```
### 3. Install Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the code: 
• numpy 
• matplotlib 
• pandas 
• scikit-learn  
You can install these dependencies using the following commands: 

```bash 
conda install numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
```
### 4. Running the Visualization Script

After setting up the environment and installing the dependencies, run the visualization script: 
  
```bash  
python visualize_embeddings.py
# This will generate a 2D plot visualizing the embeddings using t-SNE.
```
### 5. Input Files
   
The input files embeddings_output.txt and new_embeddings_output.txt contain the embeddings data for two different datasets. These files should be placed in the same directory as the script or the paths should be updated in the script accordingly. 

## Results 

The result of running the script will be a 2D scatter plot, where:
-Red points represent embeddings from the first dataset. 
-Blue points represent embeddings from the second dataset. (long sequence)

### Changes made:
1. **Code block formatting**: Fixed markdown code blocks for clarity.
2. **Improved readability**: Split long lines and added proper indentation.
3. **Fixed minor typos**: Such as “Red points represent embeddings from the first dataset” and “long sequences.”
4. **Fixed links**: The LICENSE file link now works correctly.

This should now be ready for your GitHub repository!
